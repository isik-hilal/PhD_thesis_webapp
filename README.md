## 🌟 **Overview**

This Streamlit web app is designed to:

- Showcase the **distribution and ecology of benthic foraminifera** in the Sea of Marmara.
- Highlight their **significance as biotic indices**.
- Provide a **user-friendly interface** for exploring and visualizing data.

The app is structured into several sections, each offering unique insights and tools:

- **Home** 🏠: Introduction to the project.
- **Maps** 🗺️: Interactive maps of the Sea of Marmara's foraminifera clusters.
- **Single View** 🔍: Detailed analysis for specific sites.
- **Similarity of Sites** 🤝: Visualizations of site similarities based on cluster analysis.
- **References** 📚: Key studies and sources.

## ⚙️ **Technology Stack**

The app is powered by:

- **Python** 🐍: For data manipulation and backend logic.
- **Streamlit** 🌐: To create the interactive web interface.
- **Pandas** 🐼: For data processing.
- **Plotly Express** 📈: For generating beautiful and interactive visualizations.

## 📂 **Project Structure**

The project is modular, with different sections implemented in separate Python files for better organization:

- `home.py` — Displays the introduction and welcome page.
- `maps.py` — Generates interactive maps for exploring cluster distributions.
- `analysis.py` — Provides detailed site-specific analysis.
- `cluster.py` — Contains visualizations for similarity between sites.
- `references.py` — Lists and manages reference materials.
